= Failsafe =

Failsafe NLMs used for switching lights, alarm buzzer sound for example, or a parachute.

= Enabling Failsafe =

Failsafe mode can be activated automatically or on request from the transmitter :
   * Loss of signal in the receiver,
   * Power supply voltage drop below a preset threshold,
   * The temperature rise of a sensor,
   * Or at the request from the transmitter,

Each mode Failsafe, requires a different way of NLM controller software.
