= Failsafe =

Failsafe NLMs used for switching lights, alarm buzzer sound for example, or a parachute.

== Enabling Failsafe ==

Failsafe mode can be activated automatically or on request from the transmitter :
   * Loss of signal in the receiver,
   * [https://code.google.com/p/nlm/wiki/VoltageFailsafeAlarm Power supply voltage drop below a preset threshold],
   * [https://code.google.com/p/nlm/wiki/Failsafe_temperature The temperature rise of a sensor],
   * Or at the request from the transmitter.

Each mode Failsafe, requires a different way of NLM controller software.

== Actions ==

For each of the fail-safe mode, you can assign the appropriate operation mode. Are possible to obtain:
   * Light switch strobe mode,
   * Inclusion of audible signals,
   * Release the parachute,
   * Engine cut-off,
   * Set the servos in a predetermined position.
