= How to understand the source code =

== Comments ==
Comments are preceded by a description, as well as placed at the end of the line to which they relate.
The text between the characters <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code>, as well as text prefixed with <code>//</code> means a comment.

== Fixed values ==
Begin with the prefix indicates the type of value.

The values for brightness in relation to the value of the PWM.
Three solid, determine how light will be emitted to the output circuit LEDs. 
The NLM-1 applies to all outputs, for NLM-2 applies only to go out LED1-8. 
The values of these constants can be changed to customize their own preferences. 
You can also extend the source code with the following values of what you require.
<code>
const byte LEDOFF   = 0;
const byte LEDON    = 32;
const byte LEDBLINK = 192;
</code>
Typical values for these constants are in the range of 0 to 255.

== Variable values ==
Output module circuits correspond to the respective outputs of the microprocessor.
In the source code, are marked with the prefix <code>led_nn</code>
where _nn_ corresponds to the numbers marked on the module outputs as LED-_nn_.

Input circuitry of the module correspond to the respective inputs of the microprocessor, 
are marked with the prefix <code>input_Signal n</code> where _n_ is the number of connections for the module respectively CONN-_n_.

== Functions ==
The source code is divided into functional blocks, carrying out certain tasks.
Block source code, marked feature is preceded by the prefix "void" which is a string indicating the name of the Function. The function code is placed between the braces "{}".

For the Arduino environment, the necessary functions that must be present in the code, it
<code>
void setup () {}
void loop () {}
</code>
For NLMs, the most common functions are:
<code>
void LEDS_OFF () {}
void LEDS_ON () {}
void LEDS_Failsafe () {}
void LEDS_Mode1 () {}
void LEDS_Mode2 () {}
</code>
