= Temperature Failsafe =

== Overview ==

Sometimes it happens that immediate action is needed if the temperature is exceeded. Can be connected to the module, low-cost temperature sensor.
In the illustrated example, a temperature sensor used LM35 / TMP35. You can also use any of the similar parameters.

== Reading the Analog Temperature Data ==

To convert the voltage to temperature, simply use the basic formula:
Temperature in Â°C = (Vout in mV) / 10

For NLM 2.1 with internal supply 5V<br>
Voltage at voltage_input_Signal4 = durationS4 * ( 5000 / 1024 )<br> 
This formula converts the number 0-1023 from the input_Signal4 into 0-5V

For NLM 2.2 with internal supply 3.3V<br>
Voltage at voltage_input_Signal4 = input_Signal4 * ( 3300 / 1024 )<br> 
This formula converts the number 0-1023 from the input_Signal4 into 3.3V
