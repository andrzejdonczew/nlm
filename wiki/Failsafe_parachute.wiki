If your model is equipped with a parachute, you can use the NLM, as the controller to release the parachute.

Switching to release the parachute can be when you include it on purpose from the transmitter, or if you program the failsafe mode respectively.

== Details ==

Releasing a parachute, you can do so using the PWM output software or hardware when to release you are using a servo.<br>
However, if the release you are using an electromagnetic micro switch, you can use the output LED-9 or LED-10.<br>

== Actions ==

Releasing a parachute, you can be when:
   * Turn on the switch to open the parachute from the transmitter,
   * Main supply voltage falls below the limit value,
   * Lose signal in the receiver.
